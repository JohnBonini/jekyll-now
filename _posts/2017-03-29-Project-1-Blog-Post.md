For my cohort's first project, we were asked to review data compiled for the College Board regarding SAT scores.

Each state and the District of Columbia had numbers representing a Verbal and Math score attributed to its geography. 

The goal was to assess the data and determine if the collective figures followed a typical distribution or if there was any indication of a skew. Further, our findings were to be corroborated by visual verifications of any existing pattern.
